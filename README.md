# emlang
emlang is just a pet language to learn how to build programming languages. I Will be making this following along with CraftingInterpreters initially then possibly expand on it later with other resources. I may also just scrap it and start again from scratch with learnings from this one.

Once the language is implemented I will be testing it by building a chip-8 interpreter in emlang. I fully expect this will result in changes/fixes to emlang itself during that process. But I feel this is a good test of the language & also caters to my interest in emulation.

### Platform
I will be building this using dotnet core as:
* This runs everywhere
* c# is sick
* I don't use C# at all in work, so will be good to use a different language and toolset

### Features & Syntax
Initiall this will be a C style language

### Unique Features of emlang
Nothing ... yet. Hopefully will add some features that aid in emulator development.

### Bugs Notes ToDo
All the things, but nothing specific yet

### emlang Code Examples
TBD when the language is a bit more mature
